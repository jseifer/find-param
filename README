This is a silly plugin to let you take a shortcut.  Here's the blog post example:

class Post < ActiveRecord::Base
  define_find_param :slug
end

This will set the to_param to be post.slug and add the following method to the Post model:

def self.find_by_param(*args)
  find_by_slug(*args)
end

Like I said, it's silly, but I find myself using this pattern a lot.
